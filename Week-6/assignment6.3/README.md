# Week 6 Assignment 6.3

## Problem 6.3 Sort array of 0's,1's and 2's

Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order. 

Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}
Output:0 0 1 2 2

Example 2:
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {0 1 0}
Output:0 0 1

Explanation: 0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order. 
Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints: 1 <= N <= 10^6 0 <= A[i] <= 2
