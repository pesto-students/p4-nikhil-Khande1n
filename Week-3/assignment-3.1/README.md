# Week 3 - Assignment 3.1

## Memoize a function
Create a memoize function that remembers previous inputs and stores them in cache so that it wonâ€™t have to compute the same inputs more than once. The function will take an unspecified number of integer inputs and a reducer method.(1.5hours)

Example://Given reducer method:
functionadd(a,b){returna+b}

//Create a method called memoize such that:
const memoizeAdd=memoize(add);
//then calling...memoizeAdd(100,100);
//returns 200memoizeAdd(100);
//returns 100memoizeAdd(100,200)
//returns 300memoizeAdd(100,100)
//returns 200 without computing

## Guidelines:
1.The memozie function should be written from scratch.
2.3rd party libraries such as loaddash or underscore should not have been used.
3.The function should carry a name which should denote the functionality of it.
4.The function should be able to take n number of arguments.

## Outcomes:
1.Understanding how caching works.
2.Why is it important?
3.The problem memoization solves.
