# Week 9 - Assignment

## Create a ToDo List Application in React.
●Once Application Starts, the user should see a List of todos and an option to add a new todo.●Once the user completes a todo, the user can check mark the todo and it should be marked as completed.
●For reference you can see Google Keep and try to understand the UX design.
●Use Create React App to generate starter files.
●Push it to the github repository.
●Include a .ReadMe file with steps to run the project.

## Benchmarks:
1.There should be a separate branch created in GitHub for this exercise.
2.The Project should include a ReadMe File which will lists down all the commands clearly for running application on local
3.Application should adhere to component architecture and should have meaningful component hierarchy
4.Application should handle all the validations. For example blank todo
5.There should be one or more Git commits with meaningful commit messages.
